Requirements:
1. NodeMCU(ESP8266)
2. Relays as per requirement.
3. Power supply
4. Connecting Wires


Connect the Components as shown in the wiring diagram. Open Arduino IDE and copy-paste the code. Compile and upload the code to the NodeMCU. Power on using the power adaptor and connect to Relay Switch Wi-Fi network. The login page appears. It displays the current state of the switches if they are ON or OFF. Login using username and password. Default username is admin and password is 1234. They can be edited in the code. After loggin in, the toggle switches appear.
